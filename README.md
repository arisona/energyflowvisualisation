# Energytool #
A tool for visualization of energy flow for separable energy systems like countries. The aim of this project is to provide possibility for comparisson of different energy scenarios concerning a specific energy system. This project only includes the frontend to this tool.

## Repository ##
The repository contains:
* "EnergySystemVisualization": a WebStorm project with the frontend code
* "EnergyDataGenerator": an Intellij project for generating fake energy data which was used for faking the backend
* "FakeBackend": a php index file and some generated data for running on a server which the frontend can call for getting the (currently fake) data

## Set up ##
For running the tool start a local server on port 8888 and place the folder "energytool" from the folder "FakeBackend" into your root server directory.
Run the energytool_example.html or run the porject from within WebStorm.
